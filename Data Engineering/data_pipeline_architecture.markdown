# Data Pipeline Architecture: Bronze → Silver → Gold

This document outlines the steps to build a robust data pipeline using a Bronze, Silver, and Gold layered architecture in Azure. The pipeline ingests raw data, transforms and enriches it, aggregates it for business use, and serves it for analytics, with automation and governance for reliability.

## Steps for Building the Pipeline

### 1. Data Ingestion (Raw Layer → Bronze)
- **Objective**: Ingest raw data from diverse sources into the Bronze Layer.
- **Process**:
  - Use **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to ingest data from multiple sources, such as:
    - GitHub HTTP APIs (e.g., for repository metadata).
    - SQL Tables (e.g., relational databases like Azure SQL Database).
    - Other sources (e.g., REST APIs, flat files).
  - Store raw, unprocessed data in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)**.
  - Data in the Bronze Layer remains in its original format (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) with minimal or no cleaning.
- **Outcome**: Bronze Layer contains raw, as-is data ready for processing.

### 2. Data Transformation (Cleansing → Silver Layer)
- **Objective**: Clean and enrich Bronze data to create a structured Silver Layer.
- **Process**:
  - Use **Azure Databricks** with **PySpark** and **Delta Lake** to read data from the Bronze Layer in ADLS Gen2.
  - Perform transformations:
    - Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
    - Handle missing values (e.g., impute or drop).
    - Standardize schema (e.g., consistent column names, data types).
    - Join with external datasets for enrichment (e.g., MongoDB tables for additional attributes like customer demographics).
  - Store the cleaned and enriched data back into ADLS Gen2 as the Silver Layer.
- **Outcome**: Silver Layer contains structured, cleaned, and enriched data suitable for further processing.

### 3. Data Aggregation & Business Modeling (Analytics Ready → Gold Layer)
- **Objective**: Aggregate and model Silver data for business-specific analytics.
- **Process**:
  - Process Silver data in **Azure Databricks** using PySpark/Delta Lake.
  - Perform aggregations and compute business KPIs, such as:
    - Sales per store.
    - Revenue by product.
    - Customer churn metrics.
  - Apply window functions for ranking, e.g.:
    - Top-selling products.
    - Top customers by spend.
  - Save the output as **Delta tables** in ADLS Gen2, forming the Gold Layer.
- **Outcome**: Gold Layer contains analytics-ready, curated data optimized for reporting and insights.

### 4. Data Serving
- **Objective**: Make Gold data available for analytics and visualization.
- **Process**:
  - Load Gold data from ADLS Gen2 into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for scalable querying.
  - Connect BI tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Microsoft Fabric** to create visualization dashboards.
- **Outcome**: Gold data is accessible for business intelligence and decision-making.

### 5. Orchestration & Automation
- **Objective**: Automate the pipeline for consistent execution.
- **Process**:
  - Use **ADF pipelines** or **Databricks Jobs** to schedule and automate:
    - Data ingestion (Bronze).
    - Transformations (Silver).
    - Aggregations (Gold).
  - Optionally, integrate **Apache Airflow** for complex scheduling and dependency management.
- **Outcome**: Fully automated pipeline with scheduled runs and minimal manual intervention.

### 6. Monitoring & Governance
- **Objective**: Ensure pipeline reliability, data quality, and security.
- **Process**:
  - Monitor pipeline health using:
    - **Databricks Job UI** for job status and logs.
    - **ADF monitoring** for pipeline execution metrics.
  - Enable **Delta Lake** features:
    - **ACID transactions** for data consistency.
    - **Schema enforcement** to prevent invalid data.
  - Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for Bronze, Silver, and Gold zones in ADLS Gen2.
- **Outcome**: Reliable, secure, and governed pipeline with high data quality.

## Summary
This pipeline follows a layered architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to transform raw data into analytics-ready insights:
- **Bronze**: Raw, unprocessed data from diverse sources.
- **Silver**: Cleaned, structured, and enriched data.
- **Gold**: Aggregated, business-ready data for analytics.
- **Serving**: BI tools for visualization.
- **Automation**: ADF/Databricks Jobs for scheduling.
- **Governance**: Delta Lake and RBAC for reliability and security.

This architecture ensures scalability, flexibility, and compliance for modern data workflows in Azure.
