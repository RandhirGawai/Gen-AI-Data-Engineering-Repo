# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System Guide

This guide provides a detailed overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, explaining their components, evaluation methods, and design considerations in a clear and structured way. It also includes an expanded set of interview questions and answers to help prepare for technical discussions.

## 1. Introduction to RAG Systems

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system combines information retrieval with language generation to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses a large language model (LLM) to generate responses grounded in that information. RAG systems are widely used in question-answering applications, chatbots, and knowledge management tools.

### Key Benefits

### 2.3 Retrieval

Retrieval involves fetching relevant documents or chunks based on the user’s query. It has three phases: pre-retrieval, during retrieval, and post-retrieval.

#### a. Pre-Retrieval

##### i. Query Rewriting
Rewriting the user’s query using an LLM to improve retrieval accuracy.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Query Expansion**: Adding synonyms or related terms (e.g., “car” → “car, automobile, vehicle”).
  - **Clarification**: Rephrasing ambiguous queries (e.g., “apple” → “Apple fruit” or “Apple Inc.”).
  - **Contextualization**: Adding context based on user history or domain.
- **Benefits**: Improves match with relevant documents, especially for vague queries.
- **Implementation**: Use an LLM to generate a refined query before retrieval.

##### ii. Multi-Query Generation
Generating multiple query variations to increase retrieval coverage.

- **Approach**: Create different phrasings of the query (e.g., “What is AI?” → “Define artificial intelligence,” “Explain AI concepts”).
- **Benefits**:
  - Captures diverse expressions of the same intent.
  - Improves recall by retrieving documents missed by the original query.
- **Aggregation**: Combine results using rank fusion or weighted scoring.

##### iii. Domain-Aware Routing
Directing queries to the most relevant knowledge base or index.

- **Purpose**: Ensures queries are processed by the appropriate data source (e.g., medical vs. legal documents).
- **Implementation**:
  - Rule-Based: Use predefined rules to route queries.
  - ML-Based: Train a classifier to predict the best index.
- **Benefits**: Reduces noise and improves retrieval precision.

#### b. During Retrieval

##### MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)** is a technique used in RAG systems to pick the most useful documents while avoiding repetition.

## The Problem
When you search for documents, you might get many similar results. If you just pick the top 5 most relevant documents, they might all say basically the same thing - giving you redundant information instead of diverse, comprehensive answers.

## How MMR(Maximum Marginal Relevance) Works
i. MMR balances two things:
1. **Relevance** - How well does this document answer the question?
2. **Diversity** - How different is this document from the ones already selected?

## Simple Example
Let's say you ask: *"How do I improve my sleep quality?"*

**Without MMR** (just picking top 5 most relevant):
- Document 1: "Keep your bedroom cool and dark"
- Document 2: "Maintain a cool, dark sleeping environment" 
- Document 3: "Dark, cool rooms promote better sleep"
- Document 4: "Temperature and lighting affect sleep quality"
- Document 5: "Cool temperatures help you fall asleep"

**With MMR** (balancing relevance + diversity):
- Document 1: "Keep your bedroom cool and dark" ✓
- Document 2: "Establish a consistent bedtime routine" ✓ (different topic)
- Document 3: "Avoid caffeine after 2 PM" ✓ (different topic)
- Document 4: "Exercise regularly but not before bed" ✓ (different topic)
- Document 5: "Limit screen time before sleeping" ✓ (different topic)

## The Formula
MMR = λ × (relevance to query) - (1-λ) × (similarity to already selected docs)

Where λ (lambda) controls the balance:
- λ = 1: Only care about relevance (might get duplicates)
- λ = 0: Only care about diversity (might get irrelevant docs)
- λ = 0.7: Good balance (typical setting)

This way, your RAG system gives more comprehensive, non-repetitive answers!

##### ii. Hybrid Retrieval
Combining multiple retrieval methods for better results.

- **Approaches**:
  - **Vector Search + Keyword Search**: Combines semantic understanding with exact term matching.
  - **Dense + Sparse Retrieval**: Dense (embedding-based) for context, sparse (keyword-based) for precision.
  - **Multiple Embedding Models**: Use different models for different data types.
- **Benefits**: Leverages strengths of each method to improve recall and precision.
- **Fusion**: Use rank fusion algorithms (e.g., Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to combine results.

##### iii. Reranking
Reordering retrieved documents to prioritize the most relevant ones.

- **Methods**:
  - **Cross-Encoder Models**: Score query-document pairs for relevance.
  - **Learning-to-Rank**: Train models to optimize ranking.
  - **LLM-Based Reranking**: Use an LLM to evaluate relevance.
- **Purpose**: Improves the final ranking for better generation.

#### c. Post-Retrieval

##### i. Contextual Compression

## Steps to Disable PII Logging

1. **Access Settings**:
   - Navigate to the **Copilot Studio** or **Power Virtual Agents** dashboard.
   - Go to the **Settings** menu.

2. **Configure Analytics**:
   - Locate the **Analytics** section within Settings.
   - Find the option for **PII Logging**.

3. **Disable PII Logging**:
   - Toggle the PII logging setting to **Disabled**.
   - This ensures that sensitive information, such as names, phone numbers, or account IDs, is not saved in interaction transcripts.

## Additional Best Practices
- **Review Data Inputs**: Regularly audit the types of data your bot collects to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently captured.
- **Use Input Validation**: Implement logic in your bot to filter or mask PII before processing user inputs.
- **Test Transcripts**: After disabling PII logging, verify that transcripts do not contain sensitive information.
- **Stay Compliant**: Ensure your bot adheres to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) by consulting with legal or compliance teams.

By following these steps, you can enhance user privacy and prevent the storage of sensitive PII in Power Virtual Agents or Copilot Studio.
